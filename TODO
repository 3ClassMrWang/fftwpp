Release todo:
test shifted inplace MPI transforms
Transpose work memory
Overlap MPI communication with Hermitian convolutions
wrappers
update documentation
Add MPI waits in MPI FFTs to allow overlap of comm/comp.

Release done:
speed test out-of-place conv: Done, seems to give 10% or so.

Possible future enhancements:
consider FFTW_DESTROY_INPUT 
Add shift=true option to 2D & 3D Hermitian convolutions via compact,shift
structure hflags(bool compact=true, shift=true).
